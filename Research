FIND THE BASE MEMORY ADDRESS

MACOS:

finding out "base" address of running process: sample timetracer 1 2>/dev/null | grep "Load"

:

__attribute__((no_instrument_function)) : Stop the global wrapper from being called in this specific function

gcc -finstrument-functions: generates a wrapper to every function

If I subtract the base address to the value recieved as "this_fn" I get the function offset address, which can be compared to the symbol table to get the function name
